# GoDroid_CarRentalApp
The “Car Rental System” project deals with renting cars to the users based on their preferences. It consists of a user interface where the customers can view the models, descriptions and prices of different cars available and can choose from them. So, this system provides users with accurate data and representation of a large number of available cars which could not have been possible with the manual car rental system. It can be implemented by cab operators to track their day-to-day operation
